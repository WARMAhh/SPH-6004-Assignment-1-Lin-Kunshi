## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for Assignment 1 of SPH-6004, where we build a predictor that estimates the patients' risk of kidney failure in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The assignment focuses on developing a predictive model using clinical data to help identify patients at higher risk of kidney failure, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this assignment is sourced from MIMIC IV. It contains [describe dataset contents], which are used to train and evaluate the predictive model.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Selection**: Several machine learning models were considered and evaluated for their performance in predicting kidney failure risk. Models included [list models].
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: The selected model was trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
